Install mod_ssl openssl
Generate a Private Key
# openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
Generate CSR
# openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr
PaaS (Pass)
Generate Self Signed Key
# openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt

Copy the newly generated files to the correct locations with the following commands:

sudo cp ca.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs
sudo cp ca.key /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
sudo cp ca.csr /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.csr

The next step requires the editing of the /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf file. Open that file for editing 
and locate and change the following lines:

SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt

changes to:

SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
changes to:

SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
Finally, restart the Apache daemon with the command:

# systemctl restart httpd
