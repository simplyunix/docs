rerequisite

1 - puttygen.exe
2 - ppk file

We can download puttygen.exe from offical website "https://www.putty.org"


Step 1 -

After the download execute "puttygen.exe", dialog will appear.

Step 2

2. Press "Load" button  and select your  .ppk file that contains your private key. 
If your private key file is protected with a passphrase, you will be 
prompted to supply the passphrase in order to complete the loading of the private key.

Step 3

3. Go to the main menu "Conversions" and select "Export OpenSSH key",  new window appears for "Save private key as:"
Press Yes, Choose a location where you want to save the private key and specify a filename for 
the private key file such as "linuxtopic-genkey" and choose "Save".

Step 4

Now we will Generate a public key by Choosing  a "Save public key" Button. When the "Save public key as:" window appears, specify a 
ilename for the public key file, such as "linuxtopic-genkey.pub", and choose "Save".

NOTE: if SecureCRT is configured to use a public key named "linuxtopic-genkey.pub", it  expects to find the private key 
named ""linuxtopic-genkey" in the same folder. so keep following name of file

"linuxtopic-genkey.pub" ----->  public key

"linuxtopic-genkey" ------> private key

Now you have both kye public and private.
